## About Me
I am a programmer with a deep interest in technology. My curiosity leads to my inclination to tinker with computers. I spend a lot of my time in front of a screen because I am a passionate coder. Many of the programming languages I know are self-taught through reading documentations and practice. I am currently a rising sophomore studying at New York University (Tandon School of Engineering) majoring in computer science. Using what I understand, I often experiment and create. I seek to learn, to be inspired, and to work hard doing things I enjoy.

## The Details
Here are my skills and experience at a glance. If you're interested in more than just the brief descriptions shown here, feel free to contact me. I can also provide my resume and any supplementary information.

## Current Projects
#### Pokemon GR
This is a personal fangame that I am making using ActionScript3.0. Pokemon GR is an adventure/arena game where two players explore while battling other Pokemon. So far for this project, most of the backend systems such as movement, attacking and dialogue, are implemented. I have also finished most of the graphics required for the game. However, this is a long project and there is still a great number of details that need to be worked.

#### therealgary.github.io
One of the things I've been working on recently is this website. It is a work in progress and I am still constantly updating it. The first panel is used as my playground for HTML/CSS code. I will be changing it with new works I make during my free time. Currently shown, the mountains are randomly generated and its colors change based on the time of the day. The movement of the clouds and other subtle animations is done through CSS and JavaScript. I am also working on optimizing this site for small screens and mobile display and fixing some minor cross-browser compatibility issues. I am also thinking of getting a custom domain.
